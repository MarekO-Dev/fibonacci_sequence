###Description:

fibonacci sequence is a tool that has various different features related to fibonacci sequence.

###Features:
    - Viewing fibonacci sequence given 2 starting values and limit of how many items in the sequence should there be
    - Returning the actual sequence values as a list

###Example usage:
```python
        """
        1. Import FibonacciSequence class

        from fibonacci_sequence import FibonacciSequence

        2. Create new Object

        <object_name> = FibonacciSequence([int, int], int)

        3. Call the object to view the sequence output into terminal 

        <objectname>()

        4. call the object and chain .return_sequence property for the actual sequence list

        fibonacci_sequence_list = <objectname>().return_sequence
        """
