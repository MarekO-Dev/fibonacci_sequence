### Description:

A tool that has various different features related to fibonacci sequence.

### Features:

- Viewing fibonacci sequence given 2 starting values and limit of how many items in the sequence should there be
- Returning the actual sequence values as a list

### Example usage:

1. Import FibonacciSequence class

```python

from fibonacci_sequence import FibonacciSequence

```

2. Create new Object

```python

<object_name> = FibonacciSequence([int, int], int)

```

3. Call the object to view the sequence output into terminal 

```python

<objectname> ()

```

4. call the object and chain .return_sequence property for the actual sequence list

```python

fibonacci_sequence_list = <objectname>().return_sequence

```
